--------------------------------------------------------------------

FREE Linux Bash software by LostByteSoft

No CopyRIGHT or CopyLEFT, i am juste in the CopyCENTER. That not perfect but me neither.

Easy way or not in bash to verify create and hash for files and folders.

Crc32 b2sum , cksum , sum , Sha1 (Sha are the same as Sha1) and Sha224 are not included but if you want it just ask !

Tested and created in Linux Debian Cinnamon 12

IF YOU RENAME FILES BE SURE TO RENAME THE FILE IN HASH SUM TOO.

Files and use , MD5
--------------------------------------------------------------------

check_md5_V5,3_V_XXX.sh

	The main software. Will ask for 1 files (and check if hash file exist then autoload
	OR ask for a second file WITH MULTIPLE HASH INSIDE and compare the hash include in the second specified/automatic
	file OR (if you click cancel) offer to create new md5 file.
	
	-ask for 1 file
	-watch if *.md5 exist and load (of the same name *.md5)	
	-if not exist, ask for a hash file (*.md5 *.txt).
	-If you don't provide a file will create a new *.md5 file.
	-If you provide a hash file with multiple hash inside it will take the good line.


create_md5_folder_V3,2_V_XXX.sh

	Create for a specified folder you selected all *.md5 file. Will create ONLY ONE file 
	for EACH file to hash.

create_md5_1_file_V_XXX.sh

	Create md5 for 1 file.

Files and use , SHA256
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Secure Hash Algorithms

Consider V5 as best option. But all version is working fine.

-Check_sha256_V1.sh

	The main software. Will ask for 2 files, one after another, and compare the hash
	include in the second specified file.
	
	-ask for 2 file (You must fournish 2 files)

-Check_sha256_V2.sh

	The main software. Will ask for 1 files (and check if hash file exist then
	autoload OR ask for a second file and compare the hash include in the second specified/automatic
	file.
	
	-ask for 1 file
	-watch if *.sha256 exist and load (of the same name *.sha256)
	-if not exist, ask for a hash file (*.sha256 *.txt).
	
-Check_sha256_V3.sh

	The main software. Will ask for 1 files (and check if hash file exist then autoload
	OR ask for a second file and compare the hash include in the second specified/automatic
	file OR (if you click cancel) offer to create new sha256 file.
	
	-ask for 1 file
	-watch if *.sha256 exist and load (of the same name *.sha256)	
	-if not exist, ask for a hash file (*.sha256 *.txt).
	-If you don't provide a file will create a new *.sha256 file.
	
-Check_sha256_V4.sh

	The main software. Will ask for 1 files (and check if hash file exist then autoload
	OR ask for a second file WITH MULTIPLE HASH INSIDE and compare the hash include in the second specified/automatic
	file OR (if you click cancel) offer to create new sha256 file.

	-If you don't provide a file will create a new *.sha256 file.
	-If you provide a hash file with multiple hash inside it will take the good line.
	
-check_sha256_V5,2_V_XXX.sh

	-Same as V4 but updated gui.

-check_sha256_V5,3_V_XXX.sh

	-Same as V5,2 but updated gui and software.

Specials & extras
--------------------------------------------------------------------

testfile.txt

	This is the test file to hash.

testfile.txt.sha256sum

	In this file there are the pre-calculated hash and the file name. You (if you create
	 this file) must follow the corect format, or correct the file to respect the format. 
	 HOW: Is the hash code plus two (2) spaceS and the name of the file. Only the first 
	 line is revelant for now. Exemple of the first line : 
	 0ca160e99aa0e719a4926797292654f9a26bc9591beee21a8ec6f2808616acee  testfile.txt 
	 Only the first line is revelant for now.
